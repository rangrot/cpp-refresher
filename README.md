# CPP Refresher

I realized I need to revise cpp principals and concepts 
so solving a bunch of cpp problems from all over the internet.

repository will have multiple "small projects" but I'll only be pushing .cpp and .h files.

I will keep updating the readme as frequently as possible.

TBD: Add a clickable index to problems and concepts.

## Build Environment

Compiler g++ built using code blocks.
